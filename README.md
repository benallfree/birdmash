# Twitter Mashup Widget

Hey thanks for taking on our programming challenge. Please work for 1-2 hours, but don't stress too hard. We don’t expect you to finish this challenge (unless you really want to); it’s more to get a sense of your approach to programming.

## Notes the Sinead

I have chosen to build this with PHP soley and without the use of a library

There are obviously librarys out there that may cut time in development for faster implementation. However, I wasnted to show my skill based on Code I have build in the past and that has been used by myself and others many times in various environments.

I have also used node-twitter-api for this purpose. Should I be using a more robust and versatile system and for future development, I would tend to favour the node-twitter-api route and build the entire widget within a JS environment. This would allow me more scope for building a single page application approach and increasing the performance of the code.

I have also included a class-loader.php as an example of a bolierplate I use. This allows me to build plugins very uickly and I can give you access to examples of this being used should you require further information

If you have any questions on my approach, please feel free to contact me
